                <p>Cinema reservation systems contribute to a more organized and streamlined process within movie theaters.
                <br/> The traditional rush during peak hours often led to confusion and occasional dissatisfaction among patrons. However, with reserved seating,
                <br/> theaters can manage the influx of customers more effectively, creating a more pleasant and orderly environment for everyone.
                <br/> This enhanced efficiency is not only beneficial for the patrons but also for the cinema management, as it allows for better resource allocation and planning.
